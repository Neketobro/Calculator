Features
User Interface:

The calculator is designed with a clean and intuitive layout, making it easy for users to navigate.
It includes a display area (input field) where results and calculations are shown.
Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using dedicated buttons.
The calculator supports the following operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (×)
Division (÷)
Scientific Functions:

The calculator includes trigonometric functions:
Sine (sin)
Cosine (cos)
Tangent (tan)
Users can input these functions directly into the calculation.
Parentheses Support:

Users can group calculations using parentheses ( and ) to control the order of operations.
Memory Functions:

The calculator features an "All Clear" (AC) button to reset the display.
A Backspace button allows users to delete the last entered character.
Input Handling:

The calculator accepts numeric input from 0 to 9.
It allows decimal inputs using a comma , for calculations involving fractions.
Calculation Execution:

The calculator computes results by evaluating the entered expression when the equal sign (=) button is pressed.
The eval() function is used to process the mathematical expression, returning the calculated result.
Technologies Used
HTML: Used for structuring the calculator layout, including buttons and the display area.
CSS: Although not explicitly mentioned in the code, CSS can be used to style the calculator for a more visually appealing design.
JavaScript: Used for implementing the logic behind the calculator’s functionality, including handling button clicks and performing calculations.
Potential Enhancements
Error Handling: Implement checks to handle invalid input or calculation errors gracefully.
Additional Functions: Expand the calculator to include more advanced mathematical functions, such as square roots, exponentiation, and logarithms.
Responsive Design: Improve the user interface to ensure it is mobile-friendly and works well on different screen sizes.
History Feature: Add a history log to track previous calculations for user reference.
Conclusion
This simple calculator project serves as an excellent opportunity to practice and demonstrate web development skills in JavaScript, particularly in handling user interactions and performing real-time calculations. It provides a solid foundation for further enhancements and learning in web technologies.ф
